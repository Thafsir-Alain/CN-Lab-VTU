Wanted to Learn stuffs on github! So sharing few knowledge on my current Academic Laboratory programs........ Hope it is informative!


# CN Lab Programs

## Part A
### 1. Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.
  #### TCL script(1.tcl), Namfile(1.nam), Tracefile(1.tr)
### 2. Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.
  #### TCL script(2.tcl), Namfile(2.nam), Tracefile(2.tr)
### 3. Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination.
  #### TCL script(3.tcl), Namfile(3.nam), Tracefile(3.tr)

## Part B
### 1. CRC 
### 2. Bellmanford
### 3. RSA
### 4. Leakybucket
